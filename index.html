            <h2>I started Keto in July. MyFitnessPal seemed pretty cool <br>. Spent hours setting it up and entering
                recipes only to <br>discover the macros were not reliable due to all the<br> contributions by the
                community. I was so frustrated. Then I<br> found a review of several apps (on the Keto Mojo website)<br>
                and discovered I wasn't the only one concerned about <br>unreliability of the macros on both MFP and
                CarbManager<br> (tried that too). Behold Cronometer! I love this app. It draws <br>from nutrition
                databases with minimal community<br> contributions so much, much more reliability. There are<br> many
                more free features. The user interface is easy to<br> navigate. I'm very happy with Cronometer.</h2>

                my daily vitamins through food is so<br> important to me and this has taken a HUGE load off of my<br>
                plate. I bought gold within minutes. This is set up great, <br>easy to use, links with my FitBit. I
                could go on and on.</h2>
